All set. I can’t persist memory across a reboot on my own, so I wrote a durable session notes file into your repo and pushed it so you can pick up exactly where we left off.

Saved context
•  File: C:\Users\Neo\Downloads\QScale\SESSION_NOTES.md
•  Includes: repo state (branch, remote, HEAD), what we changed, decisions, pending next steps, and a short resume checklist.
•  Pushed to remote: origin/main
•  Latest commit: c36557b docs: add SESSION_NOTES for resume context after reboot
•  Previous commit: 55a2608 chore: add README and set package metadata for QScale (private, UNLICENSED)

When you’re back
•  Run:
•  git status
•  git log --oneline --decorate -n 3 --no-pager
•  Open SESSION_NOTES.md for the checklist and next steps.
